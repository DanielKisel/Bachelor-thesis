Audio player controlled by mind.


The thesis is focusing on creation of mobile application of an audio player for the Android platform, where the main part of this application can be controlled by mind. To control the application we use NeuroSky MindWave Mobile device. In addition to using the algorithms that are freely available for this device, we focused on collecting raw brain wave data that we used for training the machine learning models to recognize certain states of brain activity. By inducing these states of brain activity we then control some processes inside the application.
